&lt;p>Through the distant paths of darkness,
Under skies that yet unknown&amp;hellip;
We were drifting, we were marching
To our long forgotten home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many months and many seasons,
Countless days and endless nights&amp;hellip;
We were hoping, we were pleading
We were yearning for the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every tale has its conclusion,
Every journey has its end,
Every word that yet unspoken,
Every prayer, guiding hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will cherish these emotions,
Filled with hope, and joy, and grief.
We will hold onto the memories
And the brightest, final dream.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
