&lt;p>Through the distant paths of darkness,&lt;br>
Under skies that yet unknown&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
We were drifting, we were marching&lt;br>
To our long forgotten home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many months and many seasons,&lt;br>
Countless days and endless nights&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
We were hoping, we were pleading&lt;br>
We were yearning for the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every tale has its conclusion,&lt;br>
Every journey has its end,&lt;br>
Every word that yet unspoken,&lt;br>
Every prayer, guiding hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will cherish these emotions,&lt;br>
Filled with hope, and joy, and grief.&lt;br>
We will hold onto the memories&lt;br>
And the brightest, final dream.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
